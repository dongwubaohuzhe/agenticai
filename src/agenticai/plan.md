# Multi-Agent Flight Delay Response System

## Objective
Design and implement a multi-agent system that responds intelligently to flight delays by managing weather checks, delay predictions, reservation adjustments, stakeholder notifications, and alternate travel suggestions.

---

## 1. System Overview
A multi-agent architecture will allow modular tools (agents) to perform specialized tasks. Each agent communicates via a shared protocol (MCP - Model Context Protocol) and accesses shared resources (calendar, file system, APIs).

---

## 2. Key Agents and Responsibilities

### 2.1 WeatherChecker Agent
- **Purpose:** Evaluate the weather at origin and destination airports.
- **Inputs:** Airport codes, date/time.
- **Outputs:** Weather risk summary.
- **Resources:** Weather API.

### 2.2 FlightDelayScanner Agent
- **Purpose:** Analyze the historical and real-time delay status of a given flight.
- **Inputs:** Flight number, route, date.
- **Outputs:** Delay probability score and status.
- **Resources:** Flight Data API.

### 2.3 ReservationAdjuster Agent
- **Purpose:** Modify hotel and transport bookings based on new arrival times.
- **Inputs:** Booking data, flight delay info.
- **Outputs:** Updated reservation confirmations, cancellation notices.
- **Resources:** File system, reservation APIs.

### 2.4 StakeholderNotifier Agent
- **Purpose:** Notify event or meeting participants about delays.
- **Inputs:** Calendar event, contacts, updated ETA.
- **Outputs:** Custom email/message notifications.
- **Resources:** Calendar system, Email/SMS service.

### 2.5 AlternativeRouteSuggester Agent
- **Purpose:** Offer backup travel options if primary route is disrupted.
- **Inputs:** Current flight status, destination, constraints.
- **Outputs:** List of alternate flights or routes.
- **Resources:** Flight/Transport APIs.

### 2.6 TravelOrganizer Agent
- **Purpose:** Organize travel-related documents and updates in a dedicated folder.
- **Inputs:** Booking details, documents, status updates.
- **Outputs:** Folder structure, status logs.
- **Resources:** File System.

## 3. Core Resources

### 3.1 File System
- Stores travel documents, logs, and updated itineraries.

### 3.2 Flight Data API
- Provides real-time flight tracking and historical delays.

### 3.3 Weather API
- Supplies current and forecast weather data.

### 3.4 Calendar System
- Accesses meeting/event schedules.

### 3.5 Messaging/Email Service
- Delivers notifications to relevant stakeholders.

## 4. Prompting System

### Prompt 1: Delay Risk Analysis
```
Context: Upcoming flight.
Situation: Uncertain weather.
Task: Predict delay.
Action: Analyze weather and historical delays.
Result: Delay likelihood summary.
```

### Prompt 2: Auto-Adjust Reservations
```
Context: Travel bookings made.
Situation: Possible delay.
Task: Modify hotel/transport reservations.
Action: Check delay status and trigger changes.
Result: Updated bookings.
```

### Prompt 3: Notify Stakeholders
```
Context: Scheduled meeting after landing.
Situation: Potential late arrival.
Task: Inform attendees.
Action: Check ETA and send notifications.
Result: Participants updated.
```

### Prompt 4: Suggest Alternate Routes
```
Context: Flight delay or cancelation.
Situation: Need timely arrival.
Task: Recommend alternates.
Action: Fetch and rank other travel options.
Result: List of alternatives.
```

### Prompt 5: Organize Travel Folder
```
Context: Multiple travel confirmations.
Situation: Need central access.
Task: Structure digital folder.
Action: Store and sync all documents.
Result: Single source of truth.
```

## 6. Next Steps
1. Build prompt modules and test them independently.
2. Create shared protocol (MCP) format.
3. Set up API integrations.
4. Build orchestrator logic for chaining agents.
5. Integrate file system and storage routines.
6. Deploy basic UI to interact with agents.

---

## 7. Expansion Ideas
- Add multilingual support for global travel.
- Incorporate ML models for better delay predictions.
- Integrate with travel booking platforms.
- Use voice assistant interface.

---

## 8. Tools & Tech Stack
- Python + FastAPI (agent logic)(use python 3.12)
- CrewAI (MCP + orchestration)
- NextJS (UI)
- use chromadb as memory
- APIs: FlightAware, OpenWeatherMap, Twilio, Google Calendar
- use Phoenix from Arize to monitor agent interactions.
